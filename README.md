# Academic Projects

This repository contains academic projects developed during my MSc in Financial Risk and Data Analysis at Sapienza University of Rome. Topics include statistical modeling, machine learning, and financial econometrics.

The content is currently being updated. I will soon upload previous works completed during the program.

## Included projects:
- [Hidden Markov Model with Skew Normal Distribution](HMM_Regime_Detection.md): An R-based project for modeling financial time series with regime-switching dynamics using Hidden Markov Models and skew-normal emissions. Includes simulation, parameter estimation, Extreme Value Theory (EVT) for tail risk modeling, and Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis with visualization of state-dependent behavior.
- [Zero-Coupon Yield Curve Estimation](ZeroCoupon_Curve.pdf): A Python-based project on zero-coupon yield curve construction using bootstrapping, interpolation, and the Nelson-Siegel-Svensson model to analyze interest rate dynamics and macroeconomic signals.
