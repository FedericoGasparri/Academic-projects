# Academic Projects

This repository contains academic projects developed during my MSc in Financial Risk and Data Analysis at Sapienza University of Rome. Topics include statistical modeling, machine learning, and financial econometrics.

The content is currently being updated. I will soon upload previous works completed during the program.
